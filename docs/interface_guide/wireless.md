# Wireless

The wireless interface may vary slightly from model to model. For example, some models do not have 5 GHz Wi-Fi, such as GL-MT300N-V2 (Mango) and GL-X300B (Collie); some do not include Wi-Fi capability, such as GL-MT2500/GL-MT2500A(Brume 2).

## Wi-Fi Status Display

GL.iNet router’s Wi-Fi networks are enabled by default, and the corresponding Wi-Fi icon will light up below the device model image on the INTERNET page.

![wifi status display](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/interface_guide/wireless/wifi_status_display.png){class="glboxshadow"}

The Wi-Fi QR code will be displayed if the cursor hovers over the enabled Wi-Fi icon. You can scan the Wi-Fi QR code using your Phone/Pad to quickly connect to the corresponding Wi-Fi.

## Wireless Settings

On the left side of web Admin Panel -> WIRELESS

The wireless page supports setting up different Wi-Fi configurations, and it includes various Wi-Fi bands such as 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz, and MLO Wi-Fi (which varies by router model), with each band further divided into Main Wi-Fi and Guest Wi-Fi networks for flexible wireless network management.

### MLO Wi-Fi

**Note**: This Wi-Fi band is only available on Flint 3 (GL-BE3600) and Slate 7 (GL-BE3600).

MLO (Multi-Link Operation) is one of the core features of Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be), designed to improve network performance, significantly reduce latency, and enhance connection stability by utilizing multiple frequency bands simultaneously such as 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz.

Click on the tabs below to learn about MLO Main WiFi and MLO Guest WiFi settings.

=== "MLO Wi-Fi"

    The MLO Main Wi-Fi allows you to configure multiple settings, including enabling/disabling Wi-Fi, selecting radio bands (at least two), enabling/disabling randomized BSSID, setting the Wi-Fi name (SSID), Wi-Fi security, Wi-Fi password, and SSID visibility.

    ![MLO Main WiFi](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/interface_guide/wireless/main_wifi_mlo.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    - If the MLO Wi-Fi radio bands include 6 GHz, the MLO Wi-Fi BSSID will synchronize when the 6GHz Wi-Fi BSSID changes.

    - The default Wi-Fi security for MLO Wi-Fi is WPA3-SAE, which is suitable for most devices that support MLO.

=== "MLO Guest Wi-Fi"

    The MLO Guest Wi-Fi allows you to configure simplified settings, including enabling/disabling Wi-Fi, selecting radio bands (at least two), setting the Wi-Fi name (SSID), Wi-Fi security, password, and SSID visibility.

### 6 GHz Wi-Fi

**Note**: This Wi-Fi band is only available on Flint 3 (GL-BE3600).

The 6 GHz Wi-Fi provides faster, more stable wireless connectivity with reduced congestion compared to 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.

Click on the tabs below to learn about 6 GHz Main WiFi and 6 GHz Guest WiFi settings.

=== "6 GHz Wi-Fi"

    The 6 GHz Main Wi-Fi allows you to configure multiple settings, including enabling/disabling Wi-Fi, setting TX power, enabling/disabling randomized BSSID, setting the Wi-Fi name (SSID), Wi-Fi security, Wi-Fi password, SSID visibility, Wi-Fi mode, bandwidth, and channel. 

    ![6G Main WiFi](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/interface_guide/wireless/main_wifi_6g.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    - Enable PSC: When PSC (Preferred Scanning Channel) is enabled, only channels with higher connectivity will be reserved to ensure 6 GHz device connections.

=== "6 GHz Guest Wi-Fi"

    The 6 GHz Guest Wi-Fi allows you to configure simplified settings, including enabling/disabling Wi-Fi, setting the Wi-Fi name (SSID), Wi-Fi security, password, and SSID visibility.

**Note**:

* The Wi-Fi QR code will be displayed beside the SSID if the cursor hovers over the QR code icon. You can scan the Wi-Fi QR code using your Phone/Pad to quickly connect to the corresponding Wi-Fi.

    ![wifi qr code](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/interface_guide/wireless/wifi_ssid_qr_code.png){class="glboxshadow"}

* **Randomized BSSID**: This feature is enabled by default. It aims to prevent the client vendors from collecting nearby Wi-Fi BSSIDs and client devices' GPS coordinates to their servers. Click [here](#randomized-bssid) for more details.

* The **Bandwidth** and **Channel** cannot be modified when the router acts as a [repeater](internet_repeater.md), as they follow that of the repeated network.

* When **Channel** is set to **Auto**, the router's Wi-Fi will not automatically switch to the DFS channel.

* When switching the Channel to a DFS one from non-DFS channel, a caution will appear as shown below.

    ![dfs channel caution](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/wireless/switch_to_dfs_caution.png){class="glboxshadow"}

* When the **Bandwidth** is set to **160 MHz** (Only some models can be set to 160MHz), the Wi-Fi will always use the DFS channel, even if you choose a non-DFS channel or Auto for Channel settings.

## Randomized BSSID

Randomized BSSID feature is available as of firmware v4.6. It aims to prevent the client vendors from collecting nearby Wi-Fi BSSIDs and client devices' GPS coordinates to their servers.

**How Client Vendors Collect Location Data**

Client vendors usually collect the geographical location data of Wi-Fi access points by leveraging their unique BSSIDs to locate devices. When client devices (e.g., mobile phones, computers) scan or connect to a router:

- If other devices are within the router’s Wi-Fi signal coverage, their location and movement trajectories may be exposed.

- If a device uses GPS for positioning, it periodically uploads nearby Wi-Fi BSSIDs and corresponding GPS coordinates to the vendor’s server.

![randomized bssid](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/interface_guide/wireless/randomized-bssid-new.jpg){class="glboxshadow"}

**Security Risks of Crowdsourced Tracking**

Even devices without GPS (or with GPS disabled) can estimate their location by querying visible BSSID info. However, this crowd-sourced location tracking system has security vulnerabilities. Attackers can use it to accumulate a global database of Wi-Fi access point locations and continuously track the movement trajectories of devices, posing a threat to user privacy and security.

**How Randomized BSSID Protects Your Privacy**

To address these vulnerabilities, GL-iNet routers implement the Randomized BSSID feature as a privacy safeguard.

In the router’s web admin panel, go to WIRELESS -> 5GHz Wi-Fi or 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, the BSSID option is enabled by default. 

With this setting, the device uses a randomly generated BSSID and renews it each time it boots. If you disable the random BSSID, the router reverts to using the real MAC address.

**Note**: For Guest Wi-Fi, the BSSID remains consistent with the Main Wi-Fi BSSID within the same frequency band.
