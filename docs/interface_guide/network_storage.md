## Introduction

Some GL.iNet models have MicroSD(TF) card slots, while some models have USB ports, supporting USB flash drives and portable external hard drives. You can set up Samba, WebDAV, DLNA shares for the disk.

The supported disk formats are NTFS, FAT32, ext4.

!!! Note 

    1. The power consumption of a USB hard drive is quite high. You should use it with an external power supply, otherwise it may cause malfunction.

    2. Some models have a USB port/MicroSD slot but have limited storage space and do not support file sharing.

## Supported models

Usually, models with USB ports or MicroSD(TF) slots support network storage (i.e. file sharing). 

For devices with flash storage of 32MB or less, the Network Storage function is not yet supported and is still under development and optimization.

## Insert Storage Device

For TF card, you need to power off the router first, insert the TF card and then power on the router.

For USB Drive, you can directly plug it into the USB port. For portable external hard drive, if you have a separate power supply, please connect it to the power supply.

Go to web Admin Panel -> APPLICATIONS -> Network Storage.

## Set Up Samba

1. Toggle on to enable Samba and click **Apply**.

    * Allow Access Samba from WAN: Enable it if you want the upstream devices to access Samba.

    ![enable samba](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/network_storage/samba_quick_setup_share/enable_samba.png){class="glboxshadow"}

2. Set the shared link. When a disk is detected, a link of **Quick Setup Share** is displayed. Click **Quick Setup Share**.

    ![samba quick setup share](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/network_storage/samba_quick_setup_share/samba_quick_setup_share.png){class="glboxshadow"}

3. Add a user. This step will be skipped if you already have an account. Then click **Next**.

5. Shared folder settings.

    For security reasons, we do not recommend enabling **Anonymous Access**.

    The user you just created will be added to **Read-Only User** by default. If you want this account to be able to write or delete files, you can remove it from Read-Only User and add it to **Writable User**. Click **Apply**.

    ![samba quick setup share, shared folder settings](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/network_storage/samba_quick_setup_share/samba_quick_setup_share_shared_folder_settings.png){class="glboxshadow"}

6. Folder access link. It shows the link for Windows and Unix-like OS. The Unix-like system include Android, iOS, macOS, Ubuntu etc. Then please try to access the Samba on various OS, check out [here](#samba-client).

    **Note:** If you enabled **Allow Access Samba from WAN** and access from WAN, you need to replace the Router IP (default 192.168.8.1) in the figure below with WAN IP which can be found in the INTERNET page.

    You can access Samba by the Finder.

    Open up the Finder and click Go -> Connect to Server on the menu. Copy & paste the Samba access link.

    ![network storage, mac os finder connect to server](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/network_storage/samba_client/finder_connect_to_server.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    It will ask for the username and password, the username is when you setup **Shared Folder Settings**.
    
    If you set up anonymous access, please choose **Guest** in the image below.

    ![network storage, mac os finder connect to server username password](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/network_storage/samba_client/finder_username_password.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    Click **Continue**, it will show the Samba on the sidebar of Finder.

=== "Android"

    There are many Android apps that support Samba, here is an example of [Cx File Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cxinventor.file.explorer&hl=en&gl=US){target="_blank"}.

    At the home page, click **NETWORK**.

    ![cx file explorer home page](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/network_storage/samba_client/cx_file_explorer_home.png){class="glboxshadow" width="400"}

    Click **New Location**.

=== "iOS"

    iOS [Files](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/files/id1232058109){target="_blank"} app support Samba, or you can use other apps, for example [Documents](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/documents-file-reader-browser/id364901807){target="_blank"}.

    The next section describes how to connect to Samba using **Files** app and **Documents** app respectively.

    - Guide of connect to Samba server by [Files](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/files/id1232058109){target="_blank"} app.

        Open the **Files** app. It's installed by default so you should find it on your home screen. As **Files** is now a removable app, you might need to reinstall it from the App Store if it doesn't show up.

        ![search files on iphone](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/network_storage/samba_client/ios15-iphone-12-pro-home-screen-search-files.jpg){class="glboxshadow" width=300"}
