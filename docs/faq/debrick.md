# Using Uboot to Debrick Your Router

You may have bricked your router if you were doing some DIY projects or flashed a wrong firmware. You may not be able to access your router but you can re-install the firmware by using Uboot failsafe.

**Note:** The Uboot operation will remove your router's settings and installed plugins.

---

Please prepare a computer with an ethernet port, if not, please prepare an additional USB Ethernet Adapter.

Please follow the procedures below to access the Uboot Web UI and re-install the firmware.

You can also refer to video tutorial below.

1. Please download firmware [here](https://dl.gl-inet.com/){target="_blank"} to your computer.

    Some models, such as GL-AR750S-EXT, is available in two formats of firmware, please use the firmware for Uboot, its file name extension is **.img**.

2. Remove the power of router. Connect your computer to the **Ethernet LAN port** of the router. You **MUST** leave all the other ports **unconnected**.

    !!! note

        For some models, certain individual LAN ports and the WAN port are interchangeable. Please do not use this LAN port. For example, on the GL-MT6000 (Flint 2), do not use LAN 1. Please use LAN 2, LAN 3, or LAN 4 instead.

3. Press and hold the Reset button firmly, and then power up the router. If your router doesn't have a power button, plugging the power in will power it on automatically.

    Then you will see a LED flashing in a regular sequence a few times, please release your finger after the sequence changes.

    The following will give the description of sequence of each model of LED flashing.

    **Note:** Same router models with different manufacturing dates may have different LED colours or flashing sequences, it won't affect the UBoot process. Please pay more attention to the change of the flashing LED.

    - For **GL-B3000(Marble)**, the blue LED light flashes 7 times, then the white light turns on and stays on.

    - For **GL-MT6000(Flint 2)**, the blue LED flashes 6 times then turns white and stays on.

    - For **GL-MT3000(Beryl AX)**, the blue LED flashes 6 times then turns white and stays on.

    - For **GL-MT2500/GL-MT2500A(Brume 2)**, the blue LED flashes 5 times then turns white and stays on.

    - For **GL-S200**, the cyan LED flashes 5 times, then briefly turns purple, then turns cyan and stays on.

    - For **GL-A1300(Slate Plus)**, the LED flashes slowly 5 times, then stays on for a short while, then flashes quickly all the time.

    - For **GL-AR150**, **GL-AR300M**, **GL-USB150(Microuter)**, **GL-AR750(Creta)**, **GL-AR750S-EXT(Slate)**, **GL-X750(Spitz)**, **GL-MT300N-V2(Mango)**, **microuter-N300**, the LED falshes 5 times.

    - For **GL-E750(Mudi)**, its screen will first display "Booting", followed by "Reset Counting 1 to 4", and finally "Please Open Web 192.168.1.1".

    - For **GL-S1300(Convexa-S), GL-B1300(Convexa-B)**, the LED flashes 4 times.
        
        The left most LED may stay on the whole time while the rightmost LED flashes 4 times, then the middle LED turns on and stays on.
        
        (For some old GL-B1300, the left most LED stays on the whole time, and both the middle LED and the rightmost LED flash 5 times simutaneously then they stays on.)

    - For **GL-SF1200**, the 5G LED flashes 5 times then stays on.

    - For **GL-AX1800(Flint)**, the blue LED flashes 5 times then turns white and stays on.

    - For **GL-AXT1800(Slate AX)**, the blue LED flashes 5 times then stays on.

    - For **GL-XE300(Puli)**, the LAN LED falshes 5 times then WIFI LED stays on.

    - For **GL-X300B(Collie)**, the WAN LED flashes 5 times then WIFI LED stays on.

    - For **GL-X3000(Spitz AX)**, the WAN LED flashes 5 times then WIFI LED stays on.

    - For **GL-XE3000(Puli AX)**, the WAN LED flashes 5 times then WIFI LED stays on.

    - For **GL-SFT1200(Opal)**, the blue LED flashes 5 times then turns white and stays on.

    - For **GL-AP1300(Cirrus)**, the power LED flashes slowly 5 times, then stays on for a short while, then flashes quickly all the time.

    - For **GL-MT1300(Beryl)**, the LED is blue at first, flash twice slowly, then flash 5 times a bit quick and turn to white and stays on.

    - For **GL-B2200(Velica)**, the two LEDs are blue at first, then turn white to flash 5 times, then turn blue and stays on.

    - For **GL-MV1000/GL-MV1000W(Brume)**, no repeat LED flashes signal. (Power and WAN LEDs will stays on the whole time.)

    - For **GL-MiFi**, the LED flashes 6 times.

    - For **GL-MT300N**, **GL-MT300A**, the LED flashes 3 times.

5. Use browser to visit **http://192.168.1.1**, this is the Uboot Web UI.

    ![Uboot web ui](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/debrick/uboot_ui.png){class="glboxshadow" width="700"}

    **Note:** The Uboot Web UI above may not be exactly the same as what you see, because the Uboot version is different for different production dates. In some extreme cases, we recommend upgrading the Uboot version. Please refer to the tutorial below.

    ??? "Upgrade the Uboot version"

        Upgrading uboot is very danerous and may brick your router. Only do this when it is necessary or being instructed.

        Mark sure you are using the correct **uboot file** 
        
        Following figure shows the Web UI of the old Uboot version of GL-AR750S. It has two **Choose file** buttons, which can be confusing for users.

        ![gl-ar750s old Uboot version](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/debrick/gl-ar750s_firmware_update_page_of_old_uboot_version.png){class="glboxshadow" width="700"}

        1. You need to download the Uboot file [here](https://github.com/gl-inet/uboot-for-qca95xx/tree/master/bin){target="_blank"} in advance.

        2. Repeat the above steps until you can access the Uboot Web UI.

        3. Use browser to visit **http://192.168.1.1/uboot.html**

            ![gl-ar750s u-boot update page](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/debrick/u-boot_update.png){class="glboxshadow" width="700"}

        4. Click the **Choose file** button and choose the Uboot file you just downloaded.

        5. Click **Update U-Boot** button.

        6. It will take several minutes to update. After a successful update, it will reboot the router.

        7. At this time you can change the IP setting back in step 4 and try to access the web Admin Panel, if you can access the web Admin Panel normally, it means the router has been rebooted.

        8. Repeate the above steps to upgrade the firmware. If the Uboot version is updated successfully, you will see that the Uboot Web UI has changed at step 5. 

6. Click **Choose file** button to find the firmware file. Then click **Update firmware** button.

7. Wait for around 3 minutes. Don't power off your device when updating. The router is ready when both power and  Wi-Fi LED are on or you can find its SSID on your device.

8. Revert the IP setting you did in step 4 and connect your device to the LAN or Wi-Fi of the router. You will be able to access the router via **192.168.8.1** again.
**Note:** It might be required to delete the browser cache and cookies or to use the incognito mode to access the router. This happens often when you installed plain OpenWrt firmware before and the browser now always redirects to luci instead of the GL.iNet Web UI.
