## Enable GoodCloud and remote access

Before sharing your device with GL.iNet technical support, please ensure your router has an additional Internet connection for stability. Set up an Ethernet or Repeater connection as a failover backup and ensure it works properly.

    Please go to **CLOUD SERVICES** -> **GoodCloud**, click **Get Started** and log in to your Cloud account in the upper right corner. If you don't have an account, register one first.
