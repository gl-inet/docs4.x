# Port Management

Port Management is available since V4.7.

On the left side of web Admin Panel -> NETWORK -> Port Management.

It shows all Ethernet ports on the router. 

Click on **WAN**, it displays the network port status, MAC mode & MAC address, as well as the negotiated network port rate of the WAN port.

- WAN/LAN: The current status of physical WAN port. You can use it as a LAN port to suit your needs. 

- MAC Mode: The MAC mode of WAN port is factory by default. You can switch it to Clone Mode or Random Mode.

- Mac Address: The MAC address of the WAN interface.

- Negotiated Network Port Rate: The current negotiated speed of WAN interface.

Click on **LAN**, it displays the negotiated network port rate of the LAN port.

Some models such as GL-MT6000 and GL-XE3000, support switching a LAN port to be WAN port, as shown below. Thus a Dual-Ethernet WAN scenario can be achieved.
