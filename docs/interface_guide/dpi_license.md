# DPI License

**Note**: This feature is now available only on **GL-MT5000 (Brume 3)**.

DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) is a core capability of intelligent network management. It can overcome the limitation of traditional routers (which only identify source or destination addresses), analyze data packet payloads in depth, and accurately identify user-accessed applications and websites through feature library comparison, enabling refined traffic classification and control.

Integrated with [Netify](https://www.netify.ai/){target="_blank"}, GL.iNet DPI feature adopts a lightweight embedded plug-in for efficient deployment. With Netify online-updated signature database, it enables reliable management, making network control more accurate and efficient.

Log in to the router's web admin panel, and navigate to **FLOW CONTROL** > **DPI License**. 

Start the **30-Day Trial** to enjoy the DPI features, including **Data Statistics**, **Content Filter**, and **QoS**.
