## First-time setup

All GL.iNet routers have a similar setup process. [Click here to learn about the first-time setup](../../faq/first_time_setup.md/).

---

## INTERNET

Log in to the router's web Admin Panel, and navigate to **INTERNET** from the left-side menu. 

This page allows you to select your internet connection type, such as Ethernet, Repeater, Tethering, and Cellular.

### Ethernet

Connect your router to an active modem or an active network device via an Ethernet cable to access the Internet. This method usually provides the fastest and most reliable Internet connection.

### Repeater

Set up your router as a repeater to extend the Wi-Fi coverage of an existing Wi-Fi network. As a repeater, it receives and retransmits wireless signals within its range, thereby extending its coverage. This method is useful when a single router cannot cover the entire usage area.

### Tethering

Connect the router's USB port to a smartphone with active mobile data via a USB cable to access the Internet. This method enables multiple devices connected to the router to access the internet using the smartphone's mobile data.

### Cellular
 
Connect the router to the internet by plugging a cellular-enabled USB modem into the router's USB port. This method is useful for sharing internet from a USB modem to all connected devices.

### Multi-WAN

Multi-WAN is a networking feature that allows you to set up your router with multiple internet connections (e.g., Ethernet, Repeater) at the same time. If the top-priority internet connection fails, the router will automatically switch to another internet connection. This is also called Failover, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted internet access.

Go to [Multi-WAN](../../interface_guide/multi-wan.md) to set the priority of each Internet connection. 

Alternatively, you can switch the Multi-WAN mode from Failover to Load Balance, which enables you to use multiple network interfaces at the same time to increase the total bandwidth of the router.

## VPN

GL.iNet routers are pre-installed with OpenVPN and WireGuard® supporting 30+ VPN services. It automatically encrypts all network traffic within the connected network, including guest devices and client devices that are not capable of running VPN encryption. Our routers can also act as VPN servers, redirecting traffic from client devices in remote locations to the VPN server via a VPN tunnel before accessing the public internet.
