# What is the wireless coverage of my router?

The router's theoretical wireless coverage is a reference value tested in an open, interference-free environment. In actual home or office scenarios, the coverage range will be reduced due to environmental obstacles and interference, and signal strength may vary in different areas. 

Here are some key factors affecting wireless coverage range.

## Wireless Chipset

As the core processing unit for Wi-Fi functions, the wireless chipset is responsible for signal encoding, decoding, and transmission control. 

Routers equipped with high-performance chipsets (such as those supporting Wi-Fi 6/6E or later protocols) can significantly improve signal transmission efficiency and anti-interference ability, achieving wider effective coverage even in complex environments. 

Older or low-end chipsets, however, are limited by processing capabilities, which impairs signal transmission distance and stability.

## Wireless Band

2.4 GHz Wi-Fi has stronger penetration and a longer coverage range but lower bandwidth, while 5 GHz Wi-Fi offers higher speed but weaker penetration, resulting in a shorter coverage range.

## TX power

The router's TX power (wireless transmitter power) serves as the foundational parameter for signal transmission. 

In a multi-router environment, some users may reduce TX power to minimize signal interference, alleviating overlaps with nearby Wi-Fi networks and improving network stability. However, this will directly shorten the Wi-Fi coverage range. 

You can adjust your router's TX power as needed in the [WIRELESS](../interface_guide/wireless.md) page of the web Admin Panel.

## Router Location

Placing the router in a central, elevated location (e.g., on a shelf or cabinet) minimizes obstructions. Avoid placing it near corners, behind furniture, or next to interference sources for optimal coverage.

## Physical Obstacles

Solid walls (especially concrete, brick, or metal walls), floors, and large furniture block or weaken Wi-Fi signals. Multi-story buildings or partitioned spaces will significantly reduce coverage compared to open areas.

## Wireless Interference

Other wireless devices (e.g., neighboring routers, smart home hubs, smart cameras) and household appliances (e.g., microwaves) can cause signal interference, narrowing the effective Wi-Fi coverage.
