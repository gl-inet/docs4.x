# QoS

!!! note

    1. This feature is now available only on **GL-MT5000 (Brume 3)**.

    2. This feature applies to local client traffic and VPN Client tunnel traffic, but not to traffic received when the router functions as a VPN Server.

QoS (Quality of Service) optimizes bandwidth allocation by prioritizing critical activities (e.g., video calls, gaming) during network congestion, reducing latency and improving overall network performance. 

Log in to the router's web admin panel, and navigate to **FLOW CONTROL** > **QoS**. 

Set your maximum upload and download speeds first (input range: 1 - 10000) for traffic scheduling. Match them to your actual internet bandwidth for the best results.

Then set priorities for different applications, and the router will allocate bandwidth accordingly.
