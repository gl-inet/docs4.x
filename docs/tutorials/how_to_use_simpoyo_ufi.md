Now you can connect your devices to the router via cable or Wi-Fi, or connect to the SIMPoYo uFi's Wi-Fi directly to enjoy internet access.

- Connect to the router via cable: Plug an Ethernet cable into the router's LAN port and your device. Ideal for wire-only devices or stable, interference-free connections.

- Connect to the router via Wi-Fi: Find the Wi-Fi SSID and Key on the router's bottom label, then connect your device to it. Suitable for multiple devices (2.4 GHz & 5 GHz), wider coverage needs, or personalized network settings on router.

- Connect to SIMPoYo uFi via Wi-Fi: Find the Wi-Fi SSID and Key on the SIMPoYo uFi's device label, then connect your devices (up to 8) to it. Functions as a standalone 2.4 GHz hotspot for added flexibility when needed.

### Connect to a Computer or Laptop

**Step 1**. Plug the SIMPoYo uFi into the USB port of your computer or laptop. It will automatically be recognized as a USB Ethernet device, making your device online right away.

**Step 2**. Other devices (e.g. smartphones, tables, etc.) can connect to the SIMPoYo uFi's 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network to access the internet simultaneously.
