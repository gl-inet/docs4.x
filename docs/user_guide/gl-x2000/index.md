## How to set up Spitz Plus

All GL.iNet routers have a simple and almost identical setup process. [Click here to learn about the first-time setup](../../faq/first_time_setup.md/).

To set up Spitz Plus, you will use one of the four supported internet connection methods: Cellular (SIM cards), ethernet, repeater, and tethering. Watch this setup video or follow the steps below.

<small>(This video uses a different GL.iNet router to demonstrate the setup but the steps are the same for Spitz Plus and other router models.)</small>

!!! note "Before you start, follow these steps (if connecting via the cellular method):"

    At least one nano SIM card is required to connect to the internet via the cellular method. Once you have the nano SIM card(s) ready, follow these steps:
    
    1. Activate your SIM card(s) if required by the SIM card carrier.
    2. Power off your router.
    3. Insert the SIM card(s) into the SIM card slots. (**Note:** Only one SIM card is active at one time. The other SIM card functions only as a backup.)

### 1. Power on the Spitz Plus

Put the two-piece power adapter together. Connect it to your router and plug it into an outlet. It will start up automatically.

### 2. Connect your device to the Spitz Plus

Connect your computer or mobile device to the router using Wi-Fi or ethernet cable.

=== "Ethernet"

    Connect your device to the router's LAN port using an ethernet cable.
