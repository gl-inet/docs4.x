# Toggle Button Settings

Some models have a toggle button, and you can customize what this button does in this page.

Supported Models: GL-AXT1800(Slate AX), GL-MT1300(Beryl), GL-MT3000(Beryl AX), GL-A1300(Slate Plus), GL-MT1300(Beryl), GL-SFT1200(Opal), GL-S200, GL-AR750S(Slate)

On the left side of web Admin Panel -> SYSTEM -> Toggle Button Settings

There are four options.

- No Function.
- AdGuard Home (On/Off)
- OpenVPN Client (On/Off)
- Tor (On/Off)
- WireGuard Client (On/Off)

When you apply the settings, you can decide whether or not to immediately enable/disable your selected feature based on the toggle switch's on/off(left/right) status.

Note that when the device reboots, it will determine the enable/disable status of the feature you have configured based on the on/off(left/right) of the toggle button. For example, if you have set up the WireGuard Client to be controlled using the toggle button. Then when the device boots, if the toggle switch is on(LEFT), WireGuard Client is enabled, otherwise it is disabled.
