After each step, check if the issue is resolved. If so, skip the remaining steps.

1. Verify that the firmware update was successful.

    First, open a web browser, access `192.168.8.1` and log in. 
    
    Then, check the firmware version in the upper-left corner. If it matches the target version, the update was successful. If not, proceed to the next step.

2. Ensure a stable network connection, then re-upload the firmware.

3. Use a different browser (e.g., Edge, Safari) to re-upload the firmware.
