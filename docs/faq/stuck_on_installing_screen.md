After each step, check if the issue is resolved. If the issue is resolved, you can skip the rest of the steps.

1. Verify whether the firmware update was successful. 
    1. In a web browser, enter `192.168.8.1` and sign in. 
    2. Check the firmware version at the top and whether it matches the version you were updating to. 
2. Upload your router's firmware again. 
3. Use a different browser (e.g., Edge, Safari) to upload your router's firmware again.
