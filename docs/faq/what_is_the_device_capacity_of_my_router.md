# What is the device capacity of my router?

Device capacity refers to the maximum number of devices a router can support stably. 

Unlike some fixed hardware specifications, the actual number of devices your router can handle is not an absolute value, but varies significantly based on real-world environment and usage habits. Here are some key factors affecting device capacity.

## Traffic Intensity

High-bandwidth activities (e.g., 4K video streaming, online gaming, large file transfers) consume more router CPU and memory resources. The more devices running such tasks concurrently, the fewer total devices the router can support stably.

## Connection Methods

Wireless devices (2.4GHz / 5GHz Wi-Fi) require more router processing power than wired Ethernet devices. Older client devices with outdated Wi-Fi chips or weak signal reception may also increase the router's resource load, reducing overall capacity.

## Hardware Performance

The router's CPU, memory, and wireless module specifications directly determine its ability to handle concurrent connections. Higher-performance hardware can manage more devices without lag or disconnections.

## Wireless Interference

Wi-Fi signal interference from neighboring routers, household appliances (microwaves, Bluetooth devices), or physical obstacles (concrete walls, metal furniture) degrades connection stability, indirectly limiting the effective number of supported devices.

## Enabled Features

Enabled router features like [VPN](../tutorials/build_your_own_wireguard_home_server_with_two_glinet_routers.md), [AdGuard Home](../interface_guide/adguardhome.md), [Parental Control](../interface_guide/parental_control.md), or [Tailscale](../interface_guide/tailscale.md) consume additional system resources, which may reduce the router's available capacity for device connections.

## Network Topology

Long-term continuous operation, or connecting multiple sub-devices (e.g., smart home hubs that link to multiple sensors), can accumulate resource usage and lower the stable device count over time.
