## How to set up a VPN 

A VPN (virtual private network) creates a secure, encrypted traffic between your device and the VPN server. It provides an additional layer of privacy and security (VPN client) and allows you to access a remote network (VPN server). Flint 2 (and other GL.iNet routers) support OpenVPN and WireGuard. Additionally, it also supports Tor.

=== "OpenVPN" 

    Flint 2 (and other GL.iNet routers) supports the OpenVPN protocol which offers strong security. To set up OpenVPN, follow these tutorials:
