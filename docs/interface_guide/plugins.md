**Note**: It is not recommended to update pre-installed plug-ins in GL.iNet official firmware, such as `nginx`, `adguard home`, `tailscale`, etc.

Third-party plugins manually installed by users can be updated; however, GL.iNet is not liable for any security issues from third-party plugins. For inquiries, please contact the respective third-party plugin authors.
