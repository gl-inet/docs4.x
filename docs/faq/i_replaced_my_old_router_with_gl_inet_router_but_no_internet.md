# I replaced my old router with a GL.iNet router but no internet

If you cannot connect to the internet after replacing your old router with a GL.iNet router, it is likely your GL.iNet router cannot get an IP address (DHCP or PPPoE) after you connect your router's WAN port to your modem.

Your internet service provider may have "locked" the MAC address of your router and does not accept new routers to be connected to your network. 

To resolve this issue, follow one of these methods:

- Clone your old router's MAC addresss to the new router. 
- Reboot your modem. If this does not resolve the issue, turn it off for 30 minutes, then turn it on. 
- Contact your internet service provider to reset the modem for you.
