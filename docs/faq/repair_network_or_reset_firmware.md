# How to repair network or factory reset?

All GL.iNet routers are equipped with a physical reset mechanism (either a reset button or a pinhole). Pressing the button or poking the pinhole has the same effect: restoring network connectivity or resetting the router to factory defaults. 

For models with a pinhole, use a pin, straightened paperclip or similar tool to perform the action.  

Ensure the router has fully booted up before performing a reset. **Do NOT** press the reset button immediately after power-up, as this may trigger U-Boot failsafe mode.

## Repair network

Press and hold the reset button for **4 seconds** then release to perform a soft reset, which can repair your network.

This operation will reboot the network interface and restore the Internet interface to default settings, while preserving Wi-Fi settings, VPN settings, system settings, etc. 

**Note**: 

1. If WiFi has been disabled, a soft reset will restore WiFi to its default enabled state.

2. A soft reset can also be used to quickly switch from non-router mode to router mode.

There are two ways to reset the firmware.

1. Using reset button.

    Press and hold the reset button for **10 seconds** then release to reset the router to factory settings. All user data will be cleared.

    **Note:** If the factory reset does not work, you might need to follow the [Uboot tutorial](debrick.md) to unbrick your router.

2. Reset firmware in web admin panel.

    Log in to your router's web admin panel, and navigate to SYSTEM -> Reset Firmware. Click on the button to reset firmware.

    **Note:** All your current settings and data will be lost. The process will take about 2 minutes. DO NOT power off the router during this process.
