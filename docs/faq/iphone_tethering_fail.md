3. Make sure the iOS version is 15 or above.

4. Unplug and replug the Lightning / Type-C cable. 

5. Use another USB cable. Ensure it supports data transfer (not just charging).

6. Use the original power supply for the router.

7. Reboot both the router and your iPhone. Sometimes rebooting the iPhone solves the tethering issue.
