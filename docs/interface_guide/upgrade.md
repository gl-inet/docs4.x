# Upgrade

On the left side of web Admin Panel -> SYSTEM -> Upgrade, you can upgrade the router's firmware version. For certain cellular models, you can also upgrade the module version if needed.

!!! Note

    Please keep the power on during the upgrade. Do **NOT** power off the router. The device will automatically reboot after upgrade, which may take a few seconds.

## Firmware Upgrade

### Online Upgrade

You can find the current firmware version here. If your router is connected to the Internet, it will check for the newer firmware version available for download.

- **Accept Preview Plan**

    If this option is enabled, you can try new features before the final version is issued and provide us with feedback. Set it once and it stays on, and you always have the option to turn it off. Note that these upgrades may not be stable. Please check [What's New?](https://www.gl-inet.com/whats-new/){target="_blank"} for the latest firmware features.

- **Online Download Failed**

    When trying to perform an online upgrade, if it displays **Download Failed**, please navigate to System -> Time Zone, and fix the time zone error (sync to browser).

- **Keep Settings:** If this option is enabled, current settings will be retained and you will be prompted to reinstall any user-installed packages after the upgrade has completed. Do NOT check this option when downgrading firmware.

Click **Install** to upgrade. 

## Module Upgrade

Starting from v4.4.12, GL.iNet cellular routers support upgrading the cellular module via web Admin Panel. You can try to upgrade the cellular module when cellular networking fails. 

### Online Upgrade

Find the current cellular module version here. If your router is connected to the Internet, it will automatically check for the latest module version directly from the manufacturer's server, simplifying the update process.
