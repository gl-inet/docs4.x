# Where to find the Device ID, MAC address and Serial Number?

## Method 1

Find these information on the bottom of your router.

For the newer models, the bottom label is similar to the image below, where it displays the device's basic information. For example, in the picture below, its MAC is **E4:95:6E:40:DB:A1**, Device ID is **hh0dba1**, and Serial Number is **7c0be4bb45d96057**.

For older models, there's no Device ID on the bottom label, but you can find the DDNS, and the first 7 characters of the DDNS is the Device ID. Take the image below as an example, its MAC is **E4:95:6E:40:DB:A1**, Devicd ID is **hh0dba1**, and Serial Number is **7c0be4bb45d96057**.

Log in to the web Admin Panel, navigate to SYSTEM -> Overview, and you will find details about your device.
