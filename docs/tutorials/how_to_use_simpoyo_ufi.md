- Connect to the router via Wi-Fi: Find the Wi-Fi SSID and Key on the router's bottom label, then connect your device to it. Suitable for multiple devices (2.4 GHz & 5 GHz), wider coverage needs, or personalized network settings on router.

- Connect to SIMPoYo uFi via Wi-Fi: Find the Wi-Fi SSID and Key on the SIMPoYo uFi's device label, then connect your devices (up to 8) to it. Functions as a standalone 2.4 GHz hotspot for added flexibility when needed.

### Connect to a Computer

**Step 1**. Plug the SIMPoYo uFi into the USB port of your computer (e.g., desktop or laptop). It will automatically be recognized as a USB Ethernet device, making your device online right away.

**Step 2**. Other devices (e.g. smartphones, tables, etc.) can connect to the SIMPoYo uFi's 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network to access the internet simultaneously.

![multi-device](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/how_to_use_simpoyo_ufi/multi-device.jpg){class="glboxshadow"}

### Connect to a USB Power Source

**Step 1**. Plug the SIMPoYo uFi into any USB power source, such as a wall charger, power bank, or car charger.

**Step 2**. Once powered on, the SIMPoYo uFi will broadcast a Wi-Fi network with the SSID **SIMPoYo-XXX**.

**Step 3**. Locate the Wi-Fi password (Key) on the device label. Use this password to connect your smartphone, tablet, laptop, or other devices to the SIMPoYo uFi's Wi-Fi for internet access.
