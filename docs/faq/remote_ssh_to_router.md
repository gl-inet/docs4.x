# How to remote SSH to GL.iNet router terminal?

- **Method 1**: If your router's network has a [public IP](../../tutorials/how_to_check_if_isp_assigns_you_a_public_ip_address), please set up a [WireGuard Server](../../interface_guide/wireguard_server) and use WireGuard to SSH to the router. If you don't have a public IP, please try methods 2 and 3.
- **Method 2**: Please [bind your device to GoodCloud](../../interface_guide/cloud/#setup), then you can [SSH to the router remotely](../../interface_guide/cloud/#remote-access-routers-terminal) by logging into the [GoodCloud website](https://www.goodcloud.xyz){target="_blank"}.
- **Method 3**: To use a reverse proxy solution, we suggest [AstroRelay](https://www.astrorelay.com/){target="_blank"}.
