!!! note

    This guide is for firmware v4.7 and above. If you are using an earlier firmware version, please visit [here](wireguard_client_v4.6.md).

WireGuardÂ® is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes **state-of-the-art cryptography**. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN.

If you have subscribed to the WireGuard service from a provider but don't know how to get the configuration files, please refer to [Get Configuration Files from WireGuard Service Providers](../tutorials/how_to_get_configuration_files_from_wireguard_service_providers.md) or contact their support.

You can set up WireGuard Client via the web Admin Panel or [mobile app](../faq/mobile_app.md). 

**The mobile app** integrates some WireGuard service providers, such as AzireVPN, Mullvad VPN, OVPN, StrongVPN, PIA VPN, etc., which means you can easily set it up by simply entering the login credentials of the WireGuard service you subscribed to. Open the app and follow the on-screen instructions to set up.

**The web Admin Panel** not only integrates some WireGuard service providers, but also provides an entry for manual configuration. You can either enter the credentials of your subscribed WireGuard service for quick setup, or manually upload a configuration file to complete the setup.

Select the corresponding WireGuard service provider below to quickly locate the step-by-step instructions.

## Set Up WireGuard Server on GL.iNet Router

Do not want to subscribe to third-party VPN services? You may purchase two GL.iNet routers â set one as WireGuard server and the other as WireGuard server.

This is especially suitable for scenarios where your home network's ISP provides a Public IP, and you want to connect to your home network via VPN when away from home to ensure security and access to internal network resources. This eliminates the cost and hassle of continuously subscribing to commercial VPN services.

For WireGuard server setup, please check [here](wireguard_server.md).
