    **Note**:

    * The **Bandwidth** and **Channel** can't be modified when [repeater](../internet_repeater/) is enabled.
    * When **Channel** set as **Auto**, WiFi will not automatically switch to the DFS channel.
    * When switch to DFS channel from non-DFS channel, it will pop up a caution.

    * When the **Bandwidth** is set to 160 MHz (Only some models can be set to 160MHz), WiFi will always use the DFS channel, even if you choose a non-DFS channel of the **Auto** option.

* 2.4G WiFi
