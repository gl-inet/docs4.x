# Where to find the Device ID, MAC address, Serial Number?

## Method 1:

For most models, you can find them on the back of your router.

For the newer models, the label on the back of the router is similar to the image below. For example, in the picture below, its MAC is **E4:95:6E:40:DB:A1**, Devicd ID is **hh0dba1** and Serial Number is **7c0be4bb45d96057**.

For older models, you can't find the Device ID, but you can find the DDNS, in fact the first 7 characters of its DDNS is the Device ID. Take the following picture as an example, its MAC is **E4:95:6E:40:DB:A1**, Devicd ID is **hh0dba1**, Serial Number is **7c0be4bb45d96057**.
