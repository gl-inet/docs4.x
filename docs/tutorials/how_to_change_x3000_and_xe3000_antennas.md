# How to install or change external antennas for Spitz AX or Puli AX

When you are setting up your Spitz AX (GL-X3000) or Puli AX (GL-XE3000) for the first time, you will have to install the six external antennas included in the package. These external antennas are: 

* 2 x Wi-Fi antennas (labeled as "WiFi 6")
* 4 x 5G NR antennas (labeled as "5G NR")

Refer to the sections below to learn how to install or change the antennas. 

## Install external antennas

To install the antennas, follow these steps: 

1. Attach the antennas (in no particular order): 
    * Attach the two identical WiFi 6 antennas to the **WiFi 1** and **WiFi 2** ports (no specific pairing is required).
    * Attach the four identical 5G NR antennas to the **MAIN**, **DIV**, **MIMO 1**, and **MIMO2** ports (no specific pairing is required).

2. Position the antennas upwards for optimal performance. 

## Change external antennas 

You can buy additional Wi-Fi or 5G NR antennas to replace those included in the package. This enables users to customize their network settings.

However, it is recommended to use the original antennas, as they have been tested multiple times before shipment to ensure optimal compatibility.

If you prefer to use other antennas, please refer to the sections below to ensure you purchase the antennas with the appropriate connectors. 

### Wi-Fi antennas

The base of the Wi-Fi antenna uses an **RP-SMA female connector** (external thread and internal needle). It requires a Wi-Fi antenna which uses an **RP-SMA male connector** (internal thread and internal hole).

### 5G NR antennas

The base of the 5G NR antenna uses a **SMA female connector** (external thread and internal hole). It requires a 5G NR antenna which uses a **SMA male connector** (internal thread and internal needle).

### Troubleshooting

If you bought the incorrect antennas, you may consider buying an adapter which converts between connectors (e.g., SMA-RP male to SMA female).
