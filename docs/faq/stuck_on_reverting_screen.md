If you are stuck at the "Reverting" screen when resetting your router's firmware, refer to the following steps to resolve the issue.

After each step, check if the issue is resolved. If resolved, skip the remaining steps.

1. Wait for at least 10 minutes to see if the reverting process completes on its own. The reverting process can sometimes take longer than expected.

2. If the reverting process does not complete after 10 minutes, power off your router by unplugging the power cable. Wait for 30 seconds, then plug the power cable back in and wait for the router to boot up.

3. In a web browser, enter `192.168.8.1`. If the reverting process was successful, you will be directed to the setup guide.

4. Enable the private/incognito mode of your browser and enter `192.168.8.1`. If the reverting process was successful, you will be directed to the setup guide.

5. Use a different browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Safari) to enter `192.168.8.1`. If the reverting process was successful, you will be directed to the setup guide.

6. If you still cannot access the router's web Admin Panel or the router is not functioning properly, try resetting the router to its factory default settings by following [this](repair_network_or_reset_firmware.md/#reset-to-factory) guide.
