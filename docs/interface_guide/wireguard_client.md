WireGuardÂ® is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes **state-of-the-art cryptography**. It aims to be [faster](https://www.wireguard.com/performance/){target="_blank"}, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN.

If you have already bought WireGuard service from a provider, but you don't know how to get the configuration files, please refer to [get configuration files from WireGuard service providers](../tutorials/how_to_get_configuration_files_from_wireguard_service_providers.md) or ask its support.

You can set up WireGuard Client via web Admin Panel or [mobile app](../faq/mobile_app.md). For the mobile app, it has already integrated some WireGuard Service Providers, they are AzireVPN, Mullvad VPN, OVPN, StrongVPN, PIA VPN.

For set up via web Admin Panel, several providers are already integrated, and connection can also be established using a configuration file.
