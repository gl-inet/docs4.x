# How to check if you have a public IP address

A public address, as opposed to a private IP address, is a unqiue numerical identifier assigned to your devices connected to the internet. You will need a public IP address if you want to host a website, set up a VPN server, or provide any online services. Your internet service provider typically provides you with one. 

If you are not sure whether you have a public IP address, follow one of these methods to check. 

**Method 1: Contact your internet service provider directly**

**Method 2: Check your IP address in your router admin panel and on the internet** 

This method will only work if your GL.iNet router is connected to the internet directly. If you have a primary router, you will need to check the IP address on the primary router's admin panel instead. In that case see [How to set up port forwarding](https://docs.gl-inet.com/router/en/4/tutorials/how_to_set_up_port_forwarding/) to forward the necessary ports from your primary router to your GL.iNet router.

1. Sign in to your router's admin panel. 
    * For GL.iNet routers, enter 192.168.8.1 into a web browser and sign in.
    * If you have more than one router in your setup, sign in to the primary router's admin panel. 
2. In the router admin panel, locate your IP address (e.g., 42.XXX.XX.)

3. In a web browser, search "what is my ip."

If the two IP addresses match, you have a public IP address.

If you do not have a public IP address, you can consider using an intranet penetration tool. It allows your website, VPN server, or services to be accessible on the internet, even if you do not have a public IP address.
