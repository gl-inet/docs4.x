## INTERNET

The internet configuration interface lets users choose to establish the type of internet connection supported by the router.

Configure the internet network by selecting **INTERNET** in the side menu within the router's web Admin Panel. 

It supports four ways to connect to the internet as listed below:

### Ethernet

Transmit data using an Ethernet cable to connect the router to an active modem or an active network device. This method usually provides the fastest and most reliable Internet connection.

### Repeater

Extend the Wi-Fi coverage area of an existing Wi-Fi network by using a router to receive wireless signals within range and forwarding the signals to a further distance. This method is most useful when a single router does not have enough range to cover the entire usage area.

### Tethering

Establish internet access with connected devices by sharing a smartphone's mobile data to the router via cable. This method is most useful when users want to use the phone's data to access the internet.
