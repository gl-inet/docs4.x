## Ensure the Firmware is V4.3.17 or Above

In the web Admin Panel, go to SYSTEM -> Upgrade, upgrade the firmware to the latest version (V4.3.17 or above). The firmware download link is [HERE](https://dl.gl-inet.com/) (online upgrade or local upgrade can both work)

## Disable the Network Acceleration

After the firmware upgrade, in the web Admin Panel, go to **NETWORK** -> **Network Acceleration**, then disable it.
