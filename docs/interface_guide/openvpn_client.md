OpenVPN is an open-source VPN protocol that makes use of virtual private network (VPN) techniques to establish safe site-to-site or point-to-point connections. 

We recommend WireGuard over OpenVPN because it is much faster. For setting up a WireGuard Client, please check out [here](wireguard_client.md).

Before you start, ensure you have an active subscription with a VPN service provider that supports OpenVPN manual configuration. Check [the list of OpenVPN-compatible VPN providers that are supported by GL.iNet](https://www.gl-inet.com/solutions/vpn/){target="_blank"}.

Generally, you need to visit the official website of the VPN service provider you subscribed first, obtain the configuration file, and upload it to the router to set it as OpenVPN Client. If you don't know how to get the configuration file, refer to [this link](#get-configuration-files-from-openvpn-service-providers) or ask their support.

You can set up your GL.iNet router as OpenVPN client through the web admin panel or [mobile app](../faq/mobile_app.md). This article focuses on setting up OpenVPN client through the web admin panel.

In the web Admin Panel, click on **VPN** -> **OpenVPN Client**. 

Click the **NordVPN** button to log in if you have a NordVPN subscription, or click on **Add Manually** to upload the OpenVPN configuration files.

## Set Up NordVPN

[NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&amp;aff_id=12016&amp;url_id=902){target="_blank"} is a popular online VPN service for speed and security.

NordVPN's OpenVPN/WireGuard quick setup is integrated into the admin panel of GL.iNet routers. You can acquire configuration files for all NordVPN servers online by entering your account credentials (obtained from the NordVPN Dashboard) in the router's web admin panel or mobile app, eliminating the need for manual file uploads.

1. Log in to your NordVPN web account [here](https://my.nordaccount.com/){target="_blank"}.

    ![nord login](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/openvpn_client/nord_login.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    After login, on the Nord Dashboard, click **NordVPN**, then click **Set up NordVPN manually**.

    ![nord dashboard](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/openvpn_client/nord_dashboard.png){class="glboxshadow"}

## Set Up OpenVPN Client Manually (for other providers)

If your OpenVPN service provider is not integrated into our admin panel, please first visit the official website of your subscribed service provider to obtain the configuration file. Next, upload it to the router to set up an OpenVPN client.

In the following steps, we will use [PIA (Private Internet Access)](https://privateinternetaccess.com/offer/GLiNET_71dx4t8bl){target="_blank"} as an example.

1. Download a configuration file from Private Internet Access official website.

2. Log in to your router's web admin panel, navigate to VPN -> OpenVPN Client, and click **Add Manually**.

    ![add manually](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/openvpn_client/manual1.png){class="glboxshadow"}

3. It will create a group on the left sidebar.

    ![add a new group](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/openvpn_client/manual2.png){class="glboxshadow"}

4. Set a descriptive name for the group (e.g., private internet access).

    ![set the new group name](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/openvpn_client/manual3.png){class="glboxshadow"}

5. Upload your OpenVPN configuration file. Input the credentials if required, then click **Apply**.

    ![manual upload files](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/openvpn_client/manual4.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    - There are 4 types of credentials for authentication:

        1. No authentication.
        
        2. Username and Password only. 
        
        3. Passphrase only.

        4. Username, Password, and Passphrase.

    Then you will see the configuration file uploaded.
     
    ![manual upload files](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/openvpn_client/manual5.png){class="glboxshadow"}

6. Click the three-dot icon on the right to start a connection.

    ![start connect](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/openvpn_client/manual6.png){class="glboxshadow"}

7. Once connected, a green dot will appear next to the configuration file.

    ![openvpn connected](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/4/tutorials/openvpn_client/manual7.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    And the VPN connection details will be displayed on the **VPN Dashboard**.

## Set Up OpenVPN Server on GL.iNet Router

If you have two GL.iNet routers, you may consider setting one as an OpenVPN server (a public IP is required), and the other as an OpenVPN client. In this way, you can establish your own VPN connection without subscribing to third-party VPN services.

For setting up OpenVPN server, please check [here](openvpn_server.md).

## Get Configuration Files from OpenVPN Service Providers

We have tested 30+ OpenVPN service providers and documented the steps to obtain configuration files. If you are unsure how to get the configuration file, please refer to the steps below.

If the service provider you subscribed to is not listed below, please contact their support for further assistance.

    1. Login your CyberGhost VPN online account.

        ![login](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/3/tutorials/openvpn_client/cyberghost/cyberghost1.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    2. Select "**VPN**" from the left-side menu, then click "**Configure Device**" and create your server configuration, as described below:

        ![config device](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/3/tutorials/openvpn_client/cyberghost/cyberghost2.jpg){class="glboxshadow"}

        ![save config](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/3/tutorials/openvpn_client/cyberghost/cyberghost3.jpg){class="glboxshadow"}

    3. Now create your server configuration, as described below:

        * **Protocol** : **OpenVPN**
        * **Country** : Since native protocol connections may only be used with exactly one server you now have to choose the country you want to surf from; the server to be used in this country will be chosen by CyberGhost automatically.
        * **Server group** : Choose the server group and the OpenVPN protocol (UDP or TCP) you want to use

        **OpenVPN UDP** allows higher speed than the TCP version but can result in broken downloads in some cases. This is the default setting.
        
        **OpenVPN TCP** allows more stable connections than the UDP version but is a bit slower. Choose this version, if you have recurrent connection issues such as sudden disconnections.

        Once the desired parameters are chosen, save them with **Save Configuration**

    4. To view the **OpenVPN** credentials that are generated for you on the configuration dashboard, press **View Configuration**.

        ![view configuration](https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/router/en/3/tutorials/openvpn_client/cyberghost/cyberghost4.png){class="glboxshadow"}

    5. After setting up your connection preferences, please take note of the following:

        * **Server Group** : This is the address of the country (server) you want to be connected with, e.g. '12345-1-ca.cg-dialup.net'. This address changes with every country you have chosen in the step before. The actual single server to be used will be chosen automatically by CyberGhost.
        * **Username** : A solely for this protocol generated user name. This is NOT your regular CyberGhost account user name, it's used only to authenticate with CyberGhost servers via Manual Configurations. You will need this when set up OpenVPN on GL.iNet routers.
        * **Password** : A solely for protocol usage generated password. This is NOT your regular CyberGhost account password, it's used only to authenticate with CyberGhost servers via Manual Configurations. You will need this when set up OpenVPN on GL.iNet routers.

        Once done, please download the configuration file. For that click on *Download Configuration* and download the config file to your computer
