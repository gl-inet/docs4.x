# How to set up a guest Wi-Fi network on GL.iNet routers

This tutorial will show you how to set up a guest Wi-Fi network on GL.iNet routers. 

A guest Wi-Fi network is a separate network on a router for devices you want to isolate from your main devices. These include guest devices and your smart home devices. By creating a guest network, you can prevent unauthorized access to and potential attacks on your primary network, enhancing your network security. 

There are two methods you can use to set up a guest Wi-Fi network on your GL.iNet router: via the [router admin panel](#set-up-a-guest-network-via-the-admin-panel) or the [GL.iNet mobile app](#set-up-a-guest-network-via-the-glinet-mobile-app). 

## Set up a guest network via the admin panel 

### 1. Enable the guest Wi-Fi network

1. In a web browser, enter `192.168.8.1`. 
2. Enter your password, then click **Login**. 
3. In the left sidebar, click **Wireless**.
